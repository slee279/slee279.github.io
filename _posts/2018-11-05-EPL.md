# Predicting Soccer Match Using Poisson and Statistical Modelings

For my capstone project at General Assembly - Data Science Immersive program, I decided to do something I have wanted to do for a while: predicting soccer results using statistical modeling. You can see my original codes in [my github repository](https://github.com/slee279/EPL).

Firstly, I want to share some useful articles on predicting soccer matches using Poisson distribution.

## Data
### EPL Past Season Table
I scraped my past seasons' data from [soccerstats.com](https://www.soccerstats.com/widetable.asp?league=england) , because I wanted to get teams' past performances to predict future matches and to predict scores using Poisson distribution. From [pinnacle](http://www.pinnacle.com/en/betting-articles/Soccer/how-to-calculate-poisson-distribution/MD62MLXUMKMXZ6A8), I was able to calculate Attack Strength and Defense Strength and merge them with my EPL data. Scraped datas had been saved to .csv files. The table should look like this:

<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    },
    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    },
    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
  
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th>Team</th>
      <th>Season</th>
      <th>Rank</th>

### EPL Fixtures Data
The EPL Fixture data were scraped from [football-data.co.uk](http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php). Among all features they have, I pulled the full time results, home team, away team. I am going to use this data to compare my prediction with the actual result, and also as my training data of my model later. The table should look like this:

<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    },
    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    },
    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
  
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>Home Team</th>
      <th>Away Team</th>
      <th>FTR</th>
      <th>Season</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <th>Arsenal</th>
      <td>Aston Villa</td>
      <td>A</td>
      <td>14</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <th>Liverpool</th>
      <td>Stoke City</td>
      <td>H</td>
      <td>14</td>
    </tr>    
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <th>Norwich</th>
      <td>Everton</td>
      <td>D</td>
      <td>14</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

## Poisson Distribution
### Predicting Scores
Here's a breif example on predicting scores in a single match using Poisson distribution. [pinnacle]()
Predicting Arsenal (Home team)’s goals
Calculate Arsenal’s Attack Strength:

Step - 1: Take the number of goals scored at home last season by the home team (Arsenal: 47) and divide by the number of home games (47/19): 2.473.
Step - 2: Divide this value by the season’s average home goals scored per game (2.473/1.559) to get an “Attack Strength” of 1.5878.
(47/19) / (592/380) = 1.5878

Calculate Aston Villa’s Defence Strength:

Step - 1: Take the number of goals conceded away from home last season by the away team (Aston Villa: 41) and divide by the number of away games (41/19): 2.158.
Step - 2: Divide this by the season’s average goals conceded by an away team per game (2.158/1.559) to get a “Defence Strength” of 1.3851.
(25/19) / (592/380) = 1.3851

We can now use the following formula to calculate the likely number of goals Arsenal might score (this is done by multiplying Arsenal's Attack Strength by Aston Villa's Defence Strength and the average number of home goals in the Premier League):

1.5878 x 1.3851 x 1.559 = 3.429

Predicting Aston Villa (Away team)’s goals
To calculate the number of goals Aston Villa might score, simply use the above formulas but replace the average number of home goals with the average number of away goals.

Aston Villa's Attack Strength:

(24/19) / (471/380) = 1.019

Arsenal's Defence Strength:

(23/19) / (471/380) = 0.977

In the same way we predicted the number of goals Arsenal will score, we can calculate the likely number of goals Aston Villa might score (done by multiplying Aston Villa's Attack Strength by Arsenal's Defence Strength and the average number of away goals in the Premier League):

1.019 x 0.977 x 1.239 = 1.234

Once we have two team's average expected number of goals, we can put those number into [Poisson calculator](https://www.danielsoper.com/statcalc/calculator.aspx?id=79).

Poisson Distribution for Arsenal vs. Aston Villa

<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    },
    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    },
    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>

<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th>Goals</th>
      <th>0</th>
      <th>1</th>
      <th>2</th>
      <th>3</th>
      <th>4</th>
      <th>5</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Arsenal</th>
      <th>0.032504</th>
      <th>0.111372</th>
      <th>0.190802</th>
      <th>0.217920</th>
      <th>0.186670</th>
      <th>0.127920</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Aston Villa</th>
      <th>0.291226</th>
      <th>0.359272</th>
      <th>0.221610</th>
      <th>0.091130</th>
      <th>0.028106</th>
      <th>0.006935</th>
    </tr>    
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

This example shows that there is a 3.25% chance that Arsenal will fail to score, but a 11.14% chance they will score a single goal and a 19.08% chance they’ll score two. Aston Villa, on the other hand, is at 29.12% not to score, 35.93% to score one and 22.16% to score two. 

As both scores are independent (mathematically-speaking), you can calculate the expected score of 1–0 by multiplying those two probabilities together – (0.111372*0.291226) =0.0324 or 3.24%.
